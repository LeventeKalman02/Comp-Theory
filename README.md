## Tasks

### Task 1: Binary Representations
This task involves creating Python functions to manipulate binary representations of numbers. The following functions are implemented:

1. rotl(x, n=1): Rotates the bits in a 32-bit unsigned integer to the left by n places.
2. rotr(x, n=1): Rotates the bits in a 32-bit unsigned integer to the right by n places.
3. ch(x, y, z): Chooses the bits from y where x has bits set to 1, and bits from z where x has bits set to 0.
4. maj(x, y, z): Performs a majority vote of bits in x, y, and z. The output has a 1 in each bit position where at least two of the inputs have 1s.
